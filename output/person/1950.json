            "value": "Luce Artist Biography The Prior-Hamblen School of artists made plain-style portraits with simple forms and little detail. When it is impossible to determine whether William Matthew Prior or his brother-in-law Sturtevant Hamblin created them, they are attributed to the Prior-Hamblen School. The Prior and Hamblen families of Maine were united with the 1828 marriage of William Matthew Prior to Rosamond Hamblen. They were a good match, as Rosamond came from a reputable family of skilled artisans and Prior was an established decorative painter. In the year of their marriage he placed an ad in the (Portland) Maine Inquirer offering &quot;side views and profiles of children at reduced prices.&quot; By 1841 the Prior and Hamblen extended families had moved together to Boston, where they lived in the home of Rosamond&#39;s brother while they established their own &quot;Painting Garret.&quot; Prior traveled as far south as Baltimore making portraits for a fee. He and his brother-in-law Sturtevant Hamblen developed a portrait style with a sliding pay scale according to the amount of detail requested by the sitter. Prior advertised these portraits as &quot;flat pictures . . . a likeness without shade or shadow at one quarter price.&quot; For a higher price (about twenty five dollars), the portraitists would produce more detailed likenesses.
